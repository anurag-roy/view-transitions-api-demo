### Requirements

- Chrome 111+

### Things to note

- ~~View Transitions API does not support MPAs yet, so I had to emulate SPA-like behaviour/navigation through the also experimental [navigation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation_API)~~

Astro now supports the View Transitions API with its `<ViewTransitions />` element which is awesome! Check out the docs [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/).
